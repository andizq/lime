Benchmarks models for LIME
==========================

This directory contains several benchmark models for LIME. These models are adapted from [van Zadelhoff et al., Astronomy and Astrophysics, 395, p.373-384 (2002)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20021226).

Models 1a/1b
------------

This model is a simple 2-level molecule problem for a 1D static cloud in spherical geometry. The density is assumed to vary as a power law, while the temperature is assumed to be constant. Models 1a and 1b differ only by the assumed abundance of the molecule. Model 1a has a moderate optical depth (τ ≃ 60 at the line center). Model 1b has a much larger opacity (τ ≃ 4800).
